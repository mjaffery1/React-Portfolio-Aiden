I was a Sales Manager for a wholesale company based in NJ for about 5 years but then I've found out I'm passionate about web development and decided to make a change. At first, I've started self-teaching myself to see if becoming a web developer is really what I wanted to do, and then I really enjoyed the process of learning new things therefore I decided to study software engineering. I'm new to the industry but I lova wat I do and I'm also dedicated to my work. I am a self-motivated individual who is always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.",
